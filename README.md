A kernel simple module that enables you to call ACPI methods by writing the
method name followed by arguments to `/proc/acpi/call`.

This module is to be considered a proof-of-concept and has been superseeded by
projects like [bbswitch](https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/bbswitch). It
allows you to tamper with your system and should be used with caution.

Want to use acpi_call via graphic interface? [Click here](https://github.com/mkottman/acpi_call/#graphic-interface)

Usage:

    echo '<call>' | sudo tee /proc/acpi/call

You can then retrieve the result of the call by checking your dmesg or:

    sudo cat /proc/acpi/call

An example to turn off discrete graphics card in a dual graphics environment
(like NVIDIA Optimus):

    # turn off discrete graphics card
    echo '\_SB.PCI0.PEG1.GFX0.DOFF' > /proc/acpi/call
    # turn it back on
    echo '\_SB.PCI0.PEG1.GFX0.DON' > /proc/acpi/call

These work on my ASUS K52J notebook, but may not work for you. For a list of
methods to try, see http://linux-hybrid-graphics.blogspot.com/ or try running
the provided script `examples/turn_off_gpu.sh`

It SHOULD be ok to test all of the methods, until you see a drop in battery
drain rate (`grep rate /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state`), however it comes
with NO WARRANTY - it may hang your computer/laptop, fail to work, etc.

You can pass parameters to `acpi_call` by writing them after the method,
separated by single space. Currently, you can pass the following parameter
types:

* ACPI_INTEGER - by writing NNN or 0xNNN, where NNN is an integer/hex
* ACPI_STRING - by enclosing the string in quotes: "hello, world"
* ACPI_BUFFER - by writing bXXXX, where XXXX is a hex string without spaces,
                or by writing { b1, b2, b3, b4 }, where b1-4 are integers

The status after a call can be read back from `/proc/acpi/call`:

* 'not called' - nothing to report
* 'Error: <description>' - the call failed
* '0xNN' - the call succeeded, and returned an integer
* '"..."' - the call succeeded, and returned a string
* '{0xNN, ...}' - the call succeeded, and returned a buffer
* '[...]' - the call succeeded, and returned a package which may contain the
   above types (integer, string and buffer) and other package types


#### Graphic interface

Found this too difficult? Try to use these programs provided by Marco Dalla Libera and do it via graphic interface:

* [acpi_call_GUI (Ubuntu and other debian-based distributions)](http://marcodallas.github.io/acpi_call_GUI/)
* [acpi_call_GUI_Fedora (Fedora version)](https://github.com/marcoDallas/acpi_call_GUI_Fedora)
